Description: Python module for working with IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6
 This library is used to create/poke/manipulate IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
 and networks in Python.  It is intended to be fast and lightweight.
 .
 This is a pure Python implementation of classes for IPv4/6 addresses and
 networks. It supports comparisons to determine if IP addresses are contained
 inside a defined network, conversion of lists of IP addresses into compact
 CIDR lists, and other IP address manipulation.
 .
 This module was incorporated into python3.3 and later as ipaddress. A direct
 backport of ipaddress is available in Debian as python-ipaddress.  There are
 incompatibilies between the two, so both are provided. This module primarily
 exists to support pip in Python 2.7 virtualenvs.
